# C++ interview-prep
C++ is a powerful and all-purpose programming tool developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs. This language is an extension of C and is by far one of the fastest object-oriented programming languages. C++ is super popular because of its high speed and compatibility.

It is widely used in the development of games and servers while some of the real-world applications of C++ are as follows

Operating systems
GUI based applications
Distributed systems
Database software
Banking applications
Advanced computations and graphics
Embedded systems
So, today, well understand the different C++ questions asked in an interview at a basic, intermediate and advanced level.

A class is a user-defined data type that has data members and member functions. Data members are the data variables and member functions are the functions that are used to perform operations on these variables.

An object is an instance of a class. Since a class is a user-defined data type so an object can also be called a variable of that data type.

A class is defined as-
